# Brutalscheduler frontend (WIP)

Simple & strictly 2-dimensional collaborative scheduler

Backend: https://github.com/InkaSimola/brutalscheduler-backend


### Plan

• Almost paper-like calendar app

• Super-minimal interface to fend off tech rage

• Strictly 2-dimensional: nothing overlaps, ever 

• Everything is visible at a glance

• Maximum data ingestion with minimum effort

• Zero fuss from change of plans - just make a change and relevant parties will be notified. They'll reciprocate by bulldozing your plans in turn
